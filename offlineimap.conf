# General definitions
##################################################

[general]

# This specifies where offlineimap is to store its metadata.
# This directory will be created if it does not already exist.

metadata = ~/.offlineimap

# This variable specifies which accounts are defined.  Separate them
# with commas.  Account names should be alphanumeric only.
# You will need to specify one section per account below.  You may
# not use "general" for an account name.
#

accounts = Test

# Offlineimap can synchronize more the one account at a time.  If you
# want to enable this feature, set the below value to something
# greater than 1.  To force it to synchronize only one account at a
# time, set it to 1.
#
# Note: if you are using autorefresh and have more than one account,
# you must set this number to be >= to the number of accounts you have;
# since any given sync run never "finishes" due to a timer, you will never
# sync your additional accounts if this is 1.

maxsyncaccounts = 1

# You can specify one or more user interface modules for OfflineIMAP
# to use.  OfflineIMAP will try the first in the list, and if it
# fails, the second, and so forth.
#
# The pre-defined options are:
# Curses.Blinkenlights -- A text-based (terminal) interface similar to
# Tk.Blinkenlights
# TTY.TTYUI -- a text-based (terminal) interface
# Noninteractive.Basic -- Noninteractive interface suitable for cronning
# Noninteractive.Quiet -- Noninteractive interface, generates no output
#                         except for errors.
# Machine.MachineUI -- Interactive interface suitable for machine
#                      parsing.
#
# You can override this with a command-line option -u.

ui = Curses.Blinkenlights, TTY.TTYUI,
     Noninteractive.Basic, Noninteractive.Quiet

# If you try to synchronize messages to a read-only folder,
# OfflineIMAP will generate a warning.  If you want to suppress these
# warnings, set ignore-readonly to yes.  Read-only IMAP folders allow
# reading but not modification, so if you try to change messages in
# the local copy of such a folder, the IMAP server will prevent
# OfflineIMAP from propogating those changes to the IMAP server.

ignore-readonly = no

########## Advanced settings

# You can give a Python source filename here and all config file
# python snippets will be evaluated in the context of that file.
# This allows you to e.g. define helper functions in the Python
# source file and call them from this config file.  You can find
# an example of this in the manual.
#
# pythonfile = ~/.offlineimap.py
#

# By default, OfflineIMAP will not exit due to a network error until
# the operating system returns an error code.  Operating systems can sometimes
# take forever to notice this.  Here you can activate a timeout on the
# socket.  This timeout applies to individual socket reads and writes,
# not to an overall sync operation.  You could perfectly well have a 30s
# timeout here and your sync still take minutes.
#
# Values in the 30-120 second range are reasonable.
#
# The default is to have no timeout beyond the OS.  Times are given in seconds.
#
# socktimeout = 60

# By default, OfflineIMAP will use fsync() to force data out to disk at
# opportune times to ensure consistency.  This can, however, reduce
# performance.  Users where /home is on SSD (Flash) may also wish to reduce
# write cycles.  Therefore, you can disable OfflineIMAP's use of fsync().
# Doing so will come at the expense of greater risk of message duplication
# in the event of a system crash or power loss.  Default is fsync = true.
# Set fsync = false ot disable fsync.
#
# fsync = true

##################################################
# Mailbox name recorder
##################################################

[mbnames]

# offlineimap can record your mailbox names in a format you specify.
# You can define the header, each mailbox item, the separator,
# and the footer.  Here is an example for Mutt.
# If enabled is yes, all six setting must be specified, even if they
# are just the empty string "".
#
# The header, peritem, sep, and footer are all Python expressions passed
# through eval, so you can (and must) use Python quoting.

enabled = no
filename = ~/Mutt/muttrc.mailboxes
header = "mailboxes "
peritem = "+%(accountname)s/%(foldername)s"
sep = " "
footer = "\n"

# You can also specify a folderfilter.  It will apply to the
# *translated* folder name here, and it takes TWO arguments:
# accountname and foldername.  In all other ways, it will
# behave identically to the folderfilter for accounts.  Please see
# that section for more information and examples.
#
# Note that this filter can be used only to further restrict mbnames
# to a subset of folders that pass the account's folderfilter.

[ui.Curses.Blinkenlights]
# Character used to indicate thread status.

statuschar = .

##################################################
# Accounts
##################################################

# This is an account definition clause.  You'll have one of these
# for each account listed in general/accounts above.

[Account Test]
########## Basic settings

# These settings specify the two folders that you will be syncing.
# You'll need to have a "Repository ..." section for each one.

localrepository = LocalExample
remoterepository = RemoteExample

########## Advanced settings

# You can have offlineimap continue running indefinately, automatically
# syncing your mail periodically.  If you want that, specify how
# frequently to do that (in minutes) here.  You can also specify
# fractional minutes (ie, 3.25).

# autorefresh = 5

# You can tell offlineimap to do a number of quicker synchronizations
# between full updates.  A quick synchronization only synchronizes
# if a Maildir folder has changed, or if an IMAP folder has received
# new messages or had messages deleted.  It does not update if the
# only changes were to IMAP flags.  Specify 0 to never do quick updates,
# -1 to always do quick updates, or a positive integer to do that many
# quick updates between each full synchronization (requires autorefresh).

# quick = 10

[Repository LocalExample]

# This is one of the two repositories that you'll work with given the
# above example.  Each repository requires a "type" declaration.
#
# The types supported are Maildir and IMAP.
#

type = Maildir

# Specify local repository.  Your IMAP folders will be synchronized
# to maildirs created under this path.  OfflineIMAP will create the
# maildirs for you as needed.

localfolders = ~/Test

# You can specify the "path separator character" used for your Maildir
# folders.  This is inserted in-between the components of the tree.
# It defaults to ".".  If you want your Maildir folders to be nested,
# set it to "/".

sep = .

# Some users on *nix platforms may not want the atime (last access
# time) to be modified by OfflineIMAP.  In these cases, they would
# want to set restoreatime to yes.  OfflineIMAP will make an effort
# to not touch the atime if you do that.
#
# In most cases, the default of no should be sufficient.

restoreatime = no

[Repository RemoteExample]

# And this is the remote repository.  We only support IMAP or Gmail here.

type = IMAP

# The following can fetch the account credentials via a python expression that
# is parsed from the pythonfile parameter. For example, a function called
# "getcredentials" that parses a file "filename" and returns the account
# details for "hostname".
# remotehosteval = getcredentials("filename", "hostname", "hostname")
# remoteusereval = getcredentials("filename", "hostname", "user")
# remotepasseval = getcredentials("filename", "hostname", "passwd")

# Specify the remote hostname.
remotehost = examplehost

# Whether or not to use SSL.
ssl = yes

# SSL Client certificate (optional)
# sslclientcert = /path/to/file.crt

# SSL Client key (optional)
# sslclientkey = /path/to/file.key

# Specify the port.  If not specified, use a default port.
# remoteport = 993

# Specify the remote user name.
remoteuser = username

# There are five ways to give the password for the remote IMAP
# server:
#
# 1. No password at all specified in the config file. If a matching
#    entry is found in ~/.netrc (see netrc (5) for information) the
#    password from the matching entry will be used. Otherwise you
#    will be prompted for the password when OfflineIMAP starts.
#
# 2. The remote password stored in this file with the remotepass
#    option. Example:
#
# remotepass = mypassword
#
# 3. The remote password stored as a single line in an external
#    file, which is referenced by the remotefile option.  Example:
#
# remotepassfile = ~/Password.IMAP.Account1
#
# 4. With a preauth tunnel.  With this method, you invoke an external
# program that is guaranteed *NOT* to ask for a password, but rather
# to read from stdin and write to stdout an IMAP procotol stream
# that begins life in the PREAUTH state.  When you use a tunnel,
# you do NOT specify a user or password (if you do, they'll be
# ignored.)  Instead, you specify a preauthtunnel, as this
# example illustrates for Courier IMAP on Debian:
#
# preauthtunnel = ssh -q imaphost '/usr/bin/imapd ./Maildir'
#
# 5. If you are using Kerberos and have the Python Kerberos package installed,
# you should not specify a remotepass.  If the user has a valid
# Kerberos TGT, OfflineIMAP will figure out the rest all by itself, and
# fall back to password authentication if needed.

########## Advanced settings

# Some IMAP servers need a "reference" which often refers to the
# "folder root".  This is most commonly needed with UW IMAP, where
# you might need to specify the directory in which your mail is
# stored.  Most users will not need this.
#
# reference = Mail

# OfflineIMAP can use multiple connections to the server in order
# to perform multiple synchronization actions simultaneously.
# This may place a higher burden on the server.  In most cases,
# setting this value to 2 or 3 will speed up the sync, but in some
# cases, it may slow things down.  The safe answer is 1.  You should
# probably never set it to a value more than 5.

maxconnections = 1

# OfflineIMAP normally closes IMAP server connections between refreshes if
# the global option autorefresh is specified.  If you wish it to keep the
# connection open, set this to true.  If not specified, the default is
# false.  Keeping the connection open means a faster sync start the
# next time and may use fewer server resources on connection, but uses
# more server memory.  This setting has no effect if autorefresh is not set.

holdconnectionopen = no

# If you want to have "keepalives" sent while waiting between syncs,
# specify the amount of time IN SECONDS between keepalives here.  Note that
# sometimes more than this amount of time might pass, so don't make it
# tight.  This setting has no effect if autorefresh and holdconnectionopen
# are not both set.

# keepalive = 60

# Normally, OfflineIMAP will expunge deleted messages from the server.
# You can disable that if you wish.  This means that OfflineIMAP will
# mark them deleted on the server, but not actually delete them.
# You must use some other IMAP client to delete them if you use this
# setting; otherwise, the messgaes will just pile up there forever.
# Therefore, this setting is definately NOT recommended.
#
# expunge = no
# You can specify a folder translator.  This must be a eval-able
# Python expression that takes a foldername arg and returns the new
# value.  I suggest a lambda.  This example below will remove "INBOX." from
# the leading edge of folders (great for Courier IMAP users)
#
# WARNING: you MUST construct this such that it NEVER returns
# the same value for two folders, UNLESS the second values are
# filtered out by folderfilter below.  Failure to follow this rule
# will result in undefined behavior
#
# nametrans = lambda foldername: re.sub('^INBOX\.', '', foldername)

# Using Courier remotely and want to duplicate its mailbox naming
# locally?  Try this:
#
# nametrans = lambda foldername: re.sub('^INBOX\.*', '.', foldername)

# You can specify which folders to sync.  You can do it several ways.
# I'll provide some examples.  The folderfilter operates on the
# *UNTRANSLATED* name, if you specify nametrans.  It should return
# true if the folder is to be included; false otherwise.
#
# Example 1: synchronizing only INBOX and Sent.
#
# folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername in ['INBOX', 'Sent']
#
# Example 2: synchronizing everything except Trash.
#
# folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername not in ['Trash']
#
# Example 3: Using a regular expression to exclude Trash and all folders
# containing the characters "Del".
#
# folderfilter = lambda foldername: not re.search('(^Trash$|Del)', foldername)
#
# If folderfilter is not specified, ALL remote folders will be
# synchronized.
#
# You can span multiple lines by indenting the others.  (Use backslashes
# at the end when required by Python syntax)  For instance:
#
# folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername in
#        ['INBOX', 'Sent Mail', 'Deleted Items',
#         'Received']
#
# FYI, you could also include every folder with:
#
# folderfilter = lambda foldername: 1
#
# And exclude every folder with:
#
# folderfilter = lambda foldername: 0

# You can specify folderincludes to include additional folders.
# It should return a Python list.  This might be used to include a
# folder that was excluded by your folderfilter rule, to include a
# folder that your server does not specify with its LIST option, or
# to include a folder that is outside your basic reference.  Some examples:
#
# To include debian.user and debian.personal:
#
# folderincludes = ['debian.user', 'debian.personal']
#
# To include your INBOX (UW IMAPd users will find this useful if they
# specify a reference):
#
# folderincludes = ['INBOX']
#
# To specify a long list:
#
# folderincludes = ['box1', 'box2', 'box3', 'box4',
#                   'box5', 'box6']

# You can specify foldersort to determine how folders are sorted.
# This affects order of synchronization and mbnames. The expression
# should return -1, 0, or 1, as the default Python cmp() does.  The
# two arguments, x and y, are strings representing the names of the folders
# to be sorted.  The sorting is applied *AFTER* nametrans, if any.
#
# To reverse the sort:
#
# foldersort = lambda x, y: -cmp(x, y)


[Repository GmailExample]

# A repository using Gmail's IMAP interface.  Any configuration
# parameter of `IMAP` type repositories can be used here.  Only
# `remoteuser` (or `remoteusereval` ) is mandatory.  Default values
# for other parameters are OK, and you should not need fiddle with
# those.
#
# The Gmail repository will use hard-coded values for `remotehost`,
# `remoteport`, `tunnel` and `ssl`.  (See
# http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=78799&topic=12814)
# Any attempt to set those parameters will be silently ignored.
#

type = Gmail

# Specify the Gmail user name. This is the only mandatory parameter.
remoteuser = username@gmail.com

# Deleting a message from a Gmail folder via the IMAP interface will
# just remove that folder's label from the message: the message will
# continue to exist in the '[Gmail]/All Mail' folder.  If `realdelete`
# is set to `True`, then deleted messages will really be deleted
# during `offlineimap` sync, by moving them to the '[Gmail]/Trash'
# folder.  BEWARE: this will deleted a messages from *all folders* it
# belongs to!
#
# See http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77657&topic=12815
realdelete = no

# The trash folder name may be different from [Gmail]/Trash
# for example on german googlemail, this setting should be
#
# trashfolder = [Google Mail]/Papierkorb
#
# The same is valid for the spam folder
#
# spamfolder = [Google Mail]/Spam
