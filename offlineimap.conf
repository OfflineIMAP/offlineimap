# Offlineimap sample configuration file

# This file documents *all* possible options and can be quite scary.
# Looking for a quick start?  Take a look at offlineimap.conf.minimal.
# More details can be found at http://www.offlineimap.org .

##################################################
# Overview
##################################################

# The default configuration file is "~/.offlineimaprc".
#
# OfflineIMAP ships with a file named "offlineimap.conf" that you should copy to
# that location and then edit.
#
# OfflineIMAP also ships a file named "offlineimap.conf.minimal" that you can
# also try.  It's useful if you want to get started with the most basic feature
# set, and you can read about other features later with "offlineimap.conf".
#
# If you want to be XDG-compatible, you can put your configuration file into
# "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/offlineimap/config".

##################################################
# General definitions
##################################################

# NOTE 1: Settings generally support python interpolation. This means
# values can contain python format strings which refer to other values
# in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section. This
# allows you for example to use common settings for multiple accounts:
#
# [Repository Gmail1]
# trashfolder: %(gmailtrashfolder)s
#
# [Repository Gmail2]
# trashfolder: %(gmailtrashfolder)s
#
# [DEFAULT]
# gmailtrashfolder = [Gmail]/Papierkorb
#
# would set the trashfolder setting for your German Gmail accounts.

# NOTE 2: Above feature implies that any '%' needs to be encoded as '%%'

# NOTE 3: Any variable that is subject to the environment variables
# ($NAME) and tilde (~username/~) expansions will receive tilde
# expansion first and only after the environment variable will be
# expanded in the resulting string. This behaviour is intentional
# as it coincides with typical shell expansion strategy.

# NOTE 4: multiple same-named sections.
# The library used to parse the configuration file has known issue when multiple
# sections have the same name. In such case, only the last section is considered.
# It is strongly discouraged to have multiple sections with the same name.
# See https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/offlineimap/issues/143 for more details.

[general]

# This specifies where OfflineIMAP is to store its metadata.
# This directory will be created if it does not already exist.
#
# Tilde and environment variable expansions will be performed.
#
#metadata = ~/.offlineimap


# This option stands in the [general] section.
#
# This variable specifies which accounts are defined. Separate them with commas.
# Account names should be alphanumeric only. You will need to specify one
# section per account below. You may not use "general" for an account name.
#
# Always use ASCII characters only.
#
accounts = Test


# This option stands in the [general] section.
#
# Offlineimap can synchronize more than one account at a time. If you want to
# enable this feature, set the below value to something greater than 1.  To
# force it to synchronize only one account at a time, set it to 1.
#
# NOTE: if you are using autorefresh and have more than one account, you must
# set this number to be >= to the number of accounts you have; since any given
# sync run never "finishes" due to a timer, you will never sync your additional
# accounts if this is 1.
#
#maxsyncaccounts = 1


# This option stands in the [general] section.
#
# You can specify one or more user interface. OfflineIMAP will try the first in
# the list, and if it fails, the second, and so forth.
#
# The pre-defined options are:
# Blinkenlights -- A fancy (terminal) interface
# TTYUI         -- a text-based (terminal) interface
# Basic         -- Noninteractive interface suitable for cron'ing
# Quiet         -- Noninteractive interface, generates no output
#                  except for errors.
# MachineUI     -- Interactive interface suitable for machine
#                  parsing.
#
# See also offlineimapui(7)
#
# You can override this with a command-line option -u.
#
#ui = basic


# This option stands in the [general] section.
#
# If you try to synchronize messages to a folder which the IMAP server
# considers read-only, OfflineIMAP will generate a warning.  If you want
# to suppress these warnings, set ignore-readonly to yes.  Read-only
# IMAP folders allow reading but not modification, so if you try to
# change messages in the local copy of such a folder, the IMAP server
# will prevent OfflineIMAP from propagating those changes to the IMAP
# server.  Note that ignore-readonly is UNRELATED to the "readonly"
# setting which prevents a repository from being modified at all.
#
#ignore-readonly = no


########## Advanced settings

# This option stands in the [general] section.
#
# You can give a Python source filename here and all config file
# python snippets will be evaluated in the context of that file.
# This allows you to e.g. define helper functions in the Python
# source file and call them from this config file.  You can find
# an example of this in the manual.
#
# Tilde and environment variable expansions will be performed.
#
#pythonfile = ~/.offlineimap.py


# This option is in the [general] section.
#
# By default, OfflineIMAP will not exit due to a network error until the
# operating system returns an error code.  Operating systems can sometimes take
# forever to notice this.  Here you can activate a timeout on the socket.  This
# timeout applies to individual socket reads and writes, not to an overall sync
# operation.  You could perfectly well have a 30s timeout here and your sync
# still take minutes.
#
# Values in the 30-120 second range are reasonable.
#
# The default is to have no timeout beyond the OS.  Times are given in seconds.
#
#socktimeout = 60


# This option stands in the [general] section.
#
# By default, OfflineIMAP will use fsync() to force data out to disk at
# opportune times to ensure consistency.  This can, however, reduce performance.
# Users where /home is on SSD (Flash) may also wish to reduce write cycles.
# Therefore, you can disable OfflineIMAP's use of fsync().  Doing so will come
# at the expense of greater risk of message duplication in the event of a system
# crash or power loss.  Default is true.  Set it to false to disable fsync.
#
#fsync = true


##################################################
# Mailbox name recorder
##################################################

[mbnames]

# OfflineIMAP can record your mailbox names in a format you specify.
# You can define the header, each mailbox item, the separator,
# and the footer.  Here is an example for Mutt.
# If enabled is yes, all six setting must be specified, even if they
# are just the empty string "".
#
# The header, peritem, sep, and footer are all Python expressions passed
# through eval, so you can (and must) use Python quoting.
#
# The incremental setting controls whether the file is written after each
# account completes or once all synced accounts are complete. This is usefull if
# an account is sightly slower than the other. It allows keeping the previous
# file rather than having it partially written.
# This works best with "no" if in one-shot mode started by cron or systemd
# timers. Default: no.
#
# The following hash key are available to the expansion for 'peritem':
# - accountname: the name of the corresponding account;
# - foldername: the name of the folder;
# - localfolders: path to the local directory hosting all Maildir
#   folders for the account.
#
# Tilde and environment variable expansions will be performed
# for "filename" knob.
#
#enabled = no
#filename = ~/Mutt/muttrc.mailboxes
#header = "mailboxes "
#peritem = "+%(accountname)s/%(foldername)s"
#sep = " "
#footer = "\n"
#incremental = no


# This option stands in the [mbnames] section.
#
# You can also specify a folderfilter.  It will apply to the *translated* folder
# name here, and it takes TWO arguments: accountname and foldername.  In all
# other ways, it will behave identically to the folderfilter for accounts.
# Please see the folderfilter option for more information and examples.
#
# This filter can be used only to further restrict mbnames to a subset of
# folders that pass the account's folderfilter.
#
# You can customize the order in which mailbox names are listed in the generated
# file by specifying a sort_keyfunc, which takes a single dict argument
# containing keys 'accountname' and 'foldername'.  This function will be called
# once for each mailbox, and should return a suitable sort key that defines this
# mailbox' position in the custom ordering.
#
# This is useful with e.g. Mutt-sidebar, which uses the mailbox order from the
# generated file when listing mailboxes in the sidebar.
#
# Default setting is:
#sort_keyfunc = lambda d: (d['accountname'], d['foldername'])


##################################################
# Accounts
##################################################

# This is an account definition clause.  You'll have one of these for each
# account listed in the "accounts" option in [general] section (above).

[Account Test]

# These settings specify the two folders that you will be syncing.
# You'll need to have a "Repository ..." section for each one.

########## Advanced settings

# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# You can have OfflineIMAP continue running indefinitely, automatically syncing
# your mail periodically.  If you want that, specify how frequently to do that
# (in minutes) here.  Fractional minutes (ie, 3.25) is allowed.
#
#autorefresh = 5


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# OfflineImap can replace a number of full updates by quick synchronizations.
# This option is ignored if maxage or startdate are used.
#
# It only synchronizes a folder if
#
#   1) a Maildir folder has changed
#
# or
#
#   2) if an IMAP folder has received new messages or had messages deleted, ie
#   it does not update if only IMAP flags have changed.
#
# Full updates need to fetch ALL flags for all messages, so this makes quite a
# performance difference (especially if syncing between two IMAP servers).
#
# Specify 0 for never, -1 for always (works even in non-autorefresh mode)
#
# A positive integer <n> to do <n> quick updates before doing another full
# synchronization (requires autorefresh).  Updates are always performed after
# <autorefresh> minutes, be they quick or full.
#
#quick = 10


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# You can specify a pre and post sync hook to execute a external command.  In
# this case a call to imapfilter to filter mail before the sync process starts
# and a custom shell script after the sync completes.
#
# The pre sync script has to complete before a sync to the account will start.
#
#presynchook = imapfilter -c someotherconfig.lua

# The historical backend is 'plain' which writes out the state in plain text
# files. See manual.
#
#status_backend = sqlite


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# If you have a limited amount of bandwidth available you can exclude larger
# messages (e.g. those with large attachments etc).  If you do this it will
# appear to OfflineIMAP that these messages do not exist at all.  They will not
# be copied, have flags changed etc.  For this to work on an IMAP server the
# server must have server side search enabled.  This works with Gmail and most
# imap servers (e.g. cyrus etc)
#
# The maximum size should be specified in bytes - e.g. 2000000 for approx 2MB
#
#maxsize = 2000000


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# maxage enables you to sync only recent messages. There are two ways to specify
# what "recent" means: if maxage is given as an integer, then only messages from
# the last maxage days will be synced. If maxage is given as a date, then only
# messages later than that date will be synced.
#
# Messages older than the cutoff will not be synced, their flags will not be
# changed, they will not be deleted, etc. For OfflineIMAP it will be like these
# messages do not exist. This will perform an IMAP search in the case of IMAP or
# Gmail and therefore requires that the server support server side searching.
#
# Known edge cases are described in offlineimap(1).
#
# maxage is allowed only when the local folder is of type Maildir. It can't be
# used with startdate.
#
# The maxage option expects an integer (for the number of days) or a date of the
# form yyyy-mm-dd.
#
#maxage = 3
#maxage = 2015-04-01


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# Maildir file format uses colon (:) separator between uniq name and info.
# Unfortunatelly colon is not allowed character in windows file name. If you
# enable maildir-windows-compatible option, OfflineIMAP will be able to store
# messages on windows drive, but you will probably loose compatibility with
# other programs working with the maildir.
#
#maildir-windows-compatible = no


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# Specifies if we want to sync GMail labels with the local repository.
# Effective only for GMail IMAP repositories.
#
# Non-ASCII characters in labels are bad handled or won't work at all.
#
#synclabels = no


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# Name of the header to use for label storage.  Format for the header
# value differs for different headers, because there are some de-facto
# "standards" set by popular clients:
#
# - X-Label or Keywords keep values separated with spaces; for these
#   you, obviously, should not have label values that contain spaces;
#
# - X-Keywords use comma (',') as the separator.
#
# To be consistent with the usual To-like headers, for the rest of header
# types we use comma as the separator.
#
# Use ASCII characters only.
#
#labelsheader = X-Keywords


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# Set of labels to be ignored.  Comma-separated list.  GMail-specific
# labels all start with backslash ('\').

# Use ASCII characters only.
#
#ignorelabels = \Inbox, \Starred, \Sent, \Draft, \Spam, \Trash, \Important


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# OfflineIMAP can strip off some headers when your messages are propagated
# back to the IMAP server.  This option carries the comma-separated list
# of headers to trim off.  Header name matching is case-sensitive.
#
# This knob is respected only by IMAP-based accounts.  Value of labelsheader
# for GMail-based accounts is automatically added to this list, you don't
# need to specify it explicitely.
#
# Use ASCII characters only.
#
#filterheaders = X-Some-Weird-Header


# This option stands in the [Account Test] section.
#
# Use proxy connection for this account. Usefull to bypass the GFW in China.
# To specify a proxy connection, join proxy type, host and port with colons.
# Available proxy types are SOCKS5, SOCKS4, HTTP.
# You also need to install PySocks through pip.
#
# Currently, this feature leaks DNS support.
#
#proxy = SOCKS5:IP:9999


[Repository LocalExample]

# Each repository requires a "type" declaration. The types supported for
# local repositories are Maildir, GmailMaildir and IMAP.
#
type = Maildir


# This option stands in the [Repository LocalExample] section.
#
# Specify local repository.  Your IMAP folders will be synchronized
# to maildirs created under this path.  OfflineIMAP will create the
# maildirs for you as needed.
#
localfolders = ~/Test


# This option stands in the [Repository LocalExample] section.
#
# You can specify the "folder separator character" used for your Maildir
# folders.  It is inserted in-between the components of the tree. If you
# want your folders to be nested directories, set it to "/". 'sep' is
# ignored for IMAP repositories, as it is queried automatically.
# Otherwise, default value is ".".
#
# Don't use quotes.
#
#sep = .


# This option stands in the [Repository LocalExample] section.
#
# startdate syncs mails starting from a given date. It applies the date
# restriction to LocalExample only. The remote repository MUST be empty
# at the first sync where this option is used.
#
# Unlike maxage, this is supported for IMAP-IMAP sync.
#
# startdate can't be used with maxage.
#
# The startdate option expects a date in the format yyyy-mm-dd.
#
#startdate = 2015-04-01


# This option stands in the [Repository LocalExample] section.
#
# Propagate deletions from local to remote. Messages deleted in this repository
# won't get deleted on remote if set to "no". Default is yes.
#
# See sync_deletes in the RemoteExample section, too.
#
# While we have positive feedbacks, this feature is still EXPERIMENTAL.
#
#sync_deletes = yes


# This option stands in the [Repository LocalExample] section.
#
# Some users may not want the atime (last access time) of folders to be
# modified by OfflineIMAP.  If 'restoreatime' is set to yes, OfflineIMAP
# will restore the atime of the "new" and "cur" folders in each maildir

#
# In nearly all cases, the default should be fine.
#
#restoreatime = no


# This option stands in the [Repository LocalExample] section.
#
# Set modification time of messages basing on the message's "Date" header. This
# option makes sense for the Maildir type, only.
#
# This is useful if you are doing some processing/finding on your Maildir (for
# example, finding messages older than 3 months), without parsing each
# file/message content.
#
# If enabled, this prevents the -q (quick mode) CLI option to work correctly.
#
# Default: no.
#
#utime_from_header = no


# This option stands in the [Repository LocalExample] section.
#
# This option is similar to "utime_from_header" and could be use as a
# complementary feature to keep track of a message date. This option only
# makes sense for the Maildir type.
#
# By default each message is stored in a file which prefix is the fetch
# timestamp and an order rank such as "1446590057_0". In a multithreading
# environment message are fetched in a random order, then you can't trust
# the file name to sort your boxes.
#
# If set to "yes" the file name prefix if build on the message "Date" header
# (which should be present) or the "Received-date" if "Date" is not
# found. If neither "Received-date" nor "Date" is found, the current system
# date is used.  Now you can quickly sort your messages using their file
# names.
#
# Used in combination with "utime_from_header" all your message would be in
# order with the correct mtime attribute.
#
#filename_use_mail_timestamp = no

# This option stands in the [Repository LocalExample] section.
#
# Map IMAP [user-defined] keywords to lowercase letters, similar to Dovecot's
# format described in http://wiki2.dovecot.org/MailboxFormat/Maildir . This
# option makes sense for the Maildir type, only.
#
# Configuration example:
#      customflag_x = some_keyword
#
# With the configuration example above enabled, all IMAP messages that have
# 'some_keyword' in their FLAGS field will have an 'x' in the flags part of the
# maildir filename:
#      1234567890.M20046P2137.mailserver,S=4542,W=4642:2,Sx
#
# Valid fields are customflag_[a-z], valid values are whatever the IMAP server
# allows.
#
# Comparison in offlineimap is case-sensitive.

#customflag_b = $OtherKeyword
#customflag_c = NonJunk
#customflag_d = ToDo

[Repository GmailLocalExample]

# This type of repository enables syncing of Gmail. All Maildir
# configuration settings are also valid here.
#
# This is a separate Repository type from Maildir because it involves
# some extra overhead which sometimes may be significant.  We look for
# modified tags in local messages by looking only to the files
# modified since last run.  This is usually rather fast, but the first
# time OfflineIMAP runs with synclabels enabled, it will have to check
# the contents of all individual messages for labels and this may take
# a while.

# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# SSL CA Cert(s) to verify the server cert against (optional).
# No SSL verification is done without this option. If it is
# specified, the CA Cert(s) need to verify the Server cert AND

# The certificate should be in PEM format.
#
# Tilde and environment variable expansions will be performed.
#
# Special value OS-DEFAULT makes OfflineIMAP to automatically
# determine system-wide location of standard trusted CA roots file
# for known OS distributions and use the first bundle encountered
# (if any).  If no system-wide CA bundle is found, OfflineIMAP
# will refuse to continue; this is done to prevent creation
# of false security expectations ("I had configured CA bundle,
# thou certificate verification shalt be present").
#
# You can also use fingerprint verification via cert_fingerprint.
# See below for more verbose explanation.
#
#sslcacertfile = /path/to/cacertfile.crt


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# If you connect via SSL/TLS (ssl = yes) and you have no CA certificate
# specified, OfflineIMAP will refuse to sync as it connects to a server
# with an unknown "fingerprint". If you are sure you connect to the
# correct server, you can then configure the presented server
# fingerprint here. OfflineIMAP will verify that the server fingerprint
# has not changed on each connect and refuse to connect otherwise.
#
# You can also configure fingerprint validation in addition to
# CA certificate validation above and it will check both:
# OfflineIMAP fill verify certificate first and if things will be fine,
# fingerprint will be validated.
#
# Multiple fingerprints can be specified, separated by commas.
#
# In Windows, Microsoft uses the term "thumbprint" instead of "fingerprint".
#
# Fingerprints must be in hexadecimal form without leading '0x':

# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# Specify the user to be authorized as.  Sometimes we want to
# authenticate with our login/password, but tell the server that we
# really want to be treated as some other user; perhaps server will
# allow us to do that (or maybe not).  Some IMAP servers migrate
# account names using this functionality: your credentials remain

# or even make it the only mechanism to be tried.
#
#remote_identity = authzuser


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.

#
# NOTE: any given mechanism will be tried ONLY if it is supported by the remote

#
# Default value is ranged is from strongest to more weak ones. Due to technical
# limitations, if GSSAPI is set, it will be tried first, no matter where it was

#auth_mechanisms = GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, XOAUTH2, PLAIN, LOGIN


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# XOAuth2 authentication (for instance, to use with Gmail).
#
# This option was tested on Gmail only, but should work
# with type = IMAP for compatible servers.
#
# Mandatory parameters are "oauth2_client_id", "oauth2_client_secret" and
# either "oauth2_refresh_token" or "oauth2_access_token".
#
# See below to learn how to get those.
#
# Specify the OAuth2 client id and secret to use for the connection..
# Here's how to register an OAuth2 client for Gmail, as of 10-2-2016:
#    - Go to the Google developer console
#         https://console.developers.google.com/project
#    - Create a new project
#    - In API & Auth, select Credentials
#    - Setup the OAuth Consent Screen
#    - Then add Credentials of type OAuth 2.0 Client ID
#    - Choose application type Other; type in a name for your client
#    - You now have a client ID and client secret
#
#oauth2_client_id = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
#oauth2_client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

# Specify the refresh token to use for the connection to the mail server.
# Here's an example of a way to get a refresh token:
#    - Clone this project: https://github.com/google/gmail-oauth2-tools
#    - Type the following command-line in a terminal and follow the instructions
#         python python/oauth2.py --generate_oauth2_token \
#            --client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
#    - Access token can be obtained using refresh token with command
#         python python/oauth2.py --user=YOUR_EMAIL --client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
#            --client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET --refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN
#
# Access tokens have limited lifetimes. If you need access beyond the lifetime
# of a single access token, you should use a refresh token. A refresh token
# allows offlineimap to obtain new access tokens.
#
# If you want to use a refresh token, make sure you disabled/removed any
# oauth2_access_token option. The access token is downloaded from the URL
# defined in the oauth2_request_url configuration option.
# If the type of the remote is IMAP, oauth2_request_url MUST be defined.
# For Gmail, the default URL is https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token.
#
#oauth2_access_token = ACCESS_TOKEN
#oauth2_request_url = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token
#oauth2_refresh_token = REFRESH_TOKEN

########## Passwords

# There are six ways to specify the password for the IMAP server:
#
# 1. No password at all specified in the config file.
#    If a matching entry is found in ~/.netrc (see netrc (5) for
#    information) this password will be used. Do note that netrc only
#    allows one entry per hostname. If there is no ~/.netrc file but
#    there is an /etc/netrc file, the password will instead be taken
#    from there. Otherwise you will be prompted for the password when
#    OfflineIMAP starts when using a UI that supports this.
#
# 2. The remote password stored in this file with the remotepass
#    option. Any '%' needs to be encoded as '%%'. Example:
#    remotepass = mypassword
#
# 3. The remote password stored as a single line in an external
#    file, which is referenced by the remotefile option.  Example:
#    remotepassfile = ~/Password.IMAP.Account1
#
# 4. With a preauth tunnel.  With this method, you invoke an external
#    program that is guaranteed *NOT* to ask for a password, but rather
#    to read from stdin and write to stdout an IMAP procotol stream that
#    begins life in the PREAUTH state.  When you use a tunnel, you do
#    NOT specify a user or password (if you do, they'll be ignored.)
#    Instead, you specify a preauthtunnel, as this example illustrates
#    for Courier IMAP on Debian:
#    preauthtunnel = ssh -q imaphost '/usr/bin/imapd ./Maildir'
#
# 5. If you are using Kerberos and have the Python Kerberos package
#    installed, you should not specify a remotepass.  If the user has a
#    valid Kerberos TGT, OfflineIMAP will figure out the rest all by
#    itself, and fall back to password authentication if needed.
#
# 6. Using arbitrary python code.  With this method, you invoke a
#    function from your pythonfile.  To use this method assign the name
#    of the function to the variable 'remotepasseval'.  Example:
#    remotepasseval = get_password("imap.example.net")
#    You can also query for the username:
#    remoteusereval = get_username("imap.example.net")
#    This method can be used to design more elaborate setups, e.g. by
#    querying the gnome-keyring via its python bindings.


########## Advanced settings


# These options stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# Tunnels. There are two types:
#
# - preauth: they teleport your connection to the remote system
#   and you don't need to authenticate yourself there; the sole
#   fact that you succeeded to get the tunnel running is enough.
#   This tunnel type was explained above in the 'Passwords' section.
#
# - transport: the just provide the transport (probably encrypted)
#   to the IMAP server, but you still need to authenticate at the
#   IMAP server.
#
# Tunnels are currently working only with IMAP servers and their
# derivatives (GMail currently).  Additionally, for GMail accounts
# preauth tunnel settings are ignored: we don't believe that there
# are ways to preauthenticate at Google mail system IMAP servers.
#
# You must choose at most one tunnel type, be wise M'Lord!
#
#preauthtunnel = ssh -q imaphost '/usr/bin/imapd ./Maildir'
#transporttunnel = openssl s_client -host myimap -port 993 -quiet


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# Some IMAP servers need a "reference" which often refers to the "folder root".
#
# This is most commonly needed with UW IMAP, where you might need to specify the
# directory in which your mail is stored. The 'reference' value will be prefixed
# to all folder paths refering to that repository. E.g. accessing folder 'INBOX'
# with "reference = Mail" will try to access Mail/INBOX.
#
# The nametrans and folderfilter functions will apply to the full path,
# including the reference prefix.  Most users will not need this.
#
#reference = Mail


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# IMAP defines an encoding for non-ASCII ("international") characters. Enable
# this option if you want to decode them to the nowadays ubiquitous UTF-8.
#
# Note that the IMAP 4rev1 specification (RFC 3501) allows both UTF-8 and
# modified UTF-7 folder names.
#
# WARNING: with this option enabled:
# - compatibility with any other version is NOT GUARANTED (including newer);
# - no support is provided.
#
#decodefoldernames = no


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# In between synchronisations, OfflineIMAP can monitor mailboxes for new
# messages using the IDLE command. If you want to enable this, specify here the
# folders you wish to monitor. IMAP protocol requires a separate connection for
# each folder monitored in this way, so setting this option will force settings
# for:
#
#  - maxconnections: to be at least the number of folders you give
#  - holdconnectionopen: to be true
#  - keepalive: to be 29 minutes unless you specify otherwise
#
# This feature isn't complete and may well have problems. See the "Known Issues"
# entry in the manual for more details.
#
# This option should return a Python list. For example
#
#idlefolders = ['INBOX', 'INBOX.Alerts']


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# OfflineIMAP can use a compressed connection to the IMAP server.
# This can result in faster downloads for some cases.
#
#usecompression = yes


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# OfflineIMAP can use multiple connections to the server in order
# to perform multiple synchronization actions simultaneously.
# This may place a higher burden on the server.  In most cases,
# setting this value to 2 or 3 will speed up the sync, but in some
# cases, it may slow things down.  The safe answer is 1.  You should
# probably never set it to a value more than 5.
#
#maxconnections = 2


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# OfflineIMAP normally closes IMAP server connections between refreshes if
# the global option autorefresh is specified.  If you wish it to keep the
# connection open, set this to true.  If not specified, the default is
# false.  Keeping the connection open means a faster sync start the
# next time and may use fewer server resources on connection, but uses
# more server memory.  This setting has no effect if autorefresh is not set.
#
#holdconnectionopen = no


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# If you want to have "keepalives" sent while waiting between syncs, specify the
# amount of time IN SECONDS between keepalives here.  Note that sometimes more
# than this amount of time might pass, so don't make it tight.  This setting has
# no effect if autorefresh and holdconnectionopen are not both set.
#
#keepalive = 60


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# Normally, OfflineIMAP will expunge deleted messages from the server.  You can
# disable that if you wish.  This means that OfflineIMAP will mark them deleted
# on the server, but not actually delete them.  You must use some other IMAP
# client to delete them if you use this setting; otherwise, the messages will
# just pile up there forever.  Therefore, this setting is definitely NOT
# recommended for a long term.
#
#expunge = no


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# Specify whether to process all mail folders on the server, or only
# those listed as "subscribed".
#
#subscribedonly = no


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# You can specify a folder translator.  This must be a eval-able.
#
# Python expression that takes a foldername arg and returns the new value. A
# lambda function is suggested.
#
# WARNING: you MUST construct it so that it NEVER returns the same value for two
# folders, UNLESS the second values are filtered out by folderfilter below.
# Failure to follow this rule will result in undefined behavior.
#
# If you enable nametrans, you will likely need to set the reversed nametrans on
# the other side. See the user documentation for details and use cases. They
# are also online at: http://www.offlineimap.org/doc/nametrans.html
#
# This example below will remove "INBOX." from the leading edge of folders
# (great for Courier IMAP users).
#
#nametrans = lambda foldername: re.sub('^INBOX\.', '', foldername)
#
# Using Courier remotely and want to duplicate its mailbox naming locally?  Try
# this:
#
#nametrans = lambda foldername: re.sub('^INBOX\.*', '.', foldername)


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# Determines if folderfilter will be invoked on each run (dynamic folder
# filtering) or filtering status will be determined at startup (default
# behaviour).
#
#dynamic_folderfilter = False


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# You can specify which folders to sync using the folderfilter setting. You can
# provide any python function (e.g. a lambda function) which will be invoked for
# each foldername. If the filter function returns True, the folder will be
# synced, if it returns False, it.
#
# The folderfilter operates on the *UNTRANSLATED* name (before any nametrans
# translation takes place).
#
# Example 1: synchronizing only INBOX and Sent.
#
#folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername in ['INBOX', 'Sent']
#
# Example 2: synchronizing everything except Trash.
#
#folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername not in ['Trash']
#
# Example 3: Using a regular expression to exclude Trash and all folders
# containing the characters "Del".
#
#folderfilter = lambda foldername: not re.search('(^Trash$|Del)', foldername)
#
# If folderfilter is not specified, ALL remote folders will be synchronized.
#
# You can span multiple lines by indenting the others.  (Use backslashes at the
# end when required by Python syntax)  For instance:
#
#folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername in [
#    'INBOX', 'Sent Mail',
#    'Deleted Items', 'Received']


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# You can specify folderincludes to include additional folders.  It should
# return a Python list.  This might be used to include a folder that was
# excluded by your folderfilter rule, to include a folder that your server does
# not specify with its LIST option, or to include a folder that is outside your
# basic reference.
#
# The 'reference' value will not be prefixed to this folder name, even if you
# have specified one.  For example:
#
#folderincludes = ['debian.user', 'debian.personal']


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# If you do not want to have any folders created on this repository,
# set the createfolders variable to False, the default is True. Using
# this feature you can e.g. disable the propagation of new folders to
# the new repository.
#
#createfolders = True


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# Propagate deletions from remote to local. Messages deleted in this repository
# won't get deleted on the local repositor if set to "no". Default is yes.
#
# See sync_deletes in the LocalExample section, too.
#
# While we have positive feedbacks, this feature is still EXPERIMENTAL.
#
#sync_deletes = yes


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# 'foldersort' determines how folders are sorted.
#
# This affects order of synchronization and mbnames. The expression should
# return -1, 0, or 1, as the default Python cmp() does.  The two arguments, x
# and y, are strings representing the names of the folders to be sorted.  The
# sorting is applied *AFTER* nametrans, if any.  The default is to sort IMAP
# folders alphabetically (case-insensitive). Usually, you should never have to
# modify this.  To eg. reverse the sort:
#
#foldersort = lambda x, y: -cmp(x, y)


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# Enable 1-way synchronization. When setting 'readonly' to True, this
# repository will not be modified during synchronization. Usefull to
# e.g. backup an IMAP server. The readonly setting can be applied to any
# type of Repository (Maildir, Imap, etc).
#
#readonly = False


# This option stands in the [Repository RemoteExample] section.
#
# You can specify a newmail hook to execute an external command upon receipt
# of new mail in the INBOX.
#
# The pythonfile must be set to import any required library.
#
# This example plays a sound file of your chosing when new mail arrives.
#
#newmail_hook = lambda: os.system(
#"cvlc --play-and-stop --play-and-exit /path/to/sound/file.mp3 > /dev/null 2>&1")


[Repository GmailExample]

# A repository using Gmail's IMAP interface.
#
# Any configuration parameter of "IMAP" type repositories can be used here.
# Only "remoteuser" (or "remoteusereval" ) is mandatory.  Default values for
# other parameters are OK, and you should not need fiddle with those.
#
# The Gmail repository will use hard-coded values for "remotehost",
# "remoteport", "tunnel" and "ssl".  Any attempt to set those parameters will be
# silently ignored. For details, see
#
#  http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=78799&topic=12814
#
# To enable GMail labels synchronisation, set the option "synclabels"
# in the corresponding "Account" section.
#
type = Gmail


# This option stands in the [Repository GmailExample] section.
#
# Specify the Gmail user name. This is the only mandatory parameter.
#
remoteuser = username@gmail.com


# This option stands in the [Repository GmailExample] section.
#
# The trash folder name may be different from [Gmail]/Trash due to localization.
# You should look for the localized names of the spam folder too: "spamfolder"
# tunable will help you to override the standard name.
#
# For example on German Gmail, this setting should be:
#
#trashfolder = [Gmail]/Papierkorb
