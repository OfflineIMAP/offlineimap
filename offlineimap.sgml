      <title>Description</title>

      <para>&OfflineIMAP; is  a  tool  to  simplify  your  e-mail
	reading.  With &OfflineIMAP;, you can read the same mailbox
	from multiple computers.  You get a current copy of your
	messages on each computer, and changes you make one place will be
	visible on all other systems.  For instance, you can delete a message
	on your home computer, and it will appear deleted on your work
	computer as well.  &OfflineIMAP; is also useful if you want to
	use a mail reader that does not have IMAP support, has poor IMAP
	support, or does not provide disconnected operation.
      </para>

      <para>&OfflineIMAP; is <emphasis>FAST</emphasis>; it synchronizes
        my two accounts with over 50 folders in 3 seconds.  Other
        similar tools might take over a minute, and achieve a
        less-reliable result.  Some mail readers can take over 10
        minutes to do the same thing, and some don't even support it
        at all.  Unlike other mail tools, &OfflineIMAP; features a
        multi-threaded synchronization algorithm that can dramatically
        speed up performance in many situations by synchronizing
        several different things simultaneously.
      </para>

      <para>&OfflineIMAP; is <emphasis>FLEXIBLE</emphasis>; you can
        customize which folders are synced via regular expressions,
        lists, or Python expressions; a versatile and comprehensive
        configuration file is used to control behavior; two user
        interfaces are built-in; fine-tuning of synchronization
        performance is possible; internal or external automation is
        supported; SSL and PREAUTH tunnels are both supported; offline
        (or "unplugged") reading is supported; and esoteric IMAP
        features are supported to ensure compatibility with the widest
        variety of IMAP servers.
      </para>

      <para>&OfflineIMAP; is <emphasis>SAFE</emphasis>; it uses an
        algorithm designed to prevent mail loss at all costs.  Because
        of the design of this algorithm, even programming errors
        should not result in loss of mail.  I am so confident in the
        algorithm that I use my own personal and work accounts for
        testing of &OfflineIMAP; pre-release, development, and beta
	releases.  Of course, legally speaking, &OfflineIMAP; comes
        with no warranty, so I am not responsible if this turns out
        to be wrong.
      </para>

      <refsect2>
        <title>Method of Operation</title>
       
        <para>&OfflineIMAP; traditionally 
	  operates by maintaining a hierarchy of
	  mail folders in Maildir format locally.  Your own mail
	  reader will read mail from this tree, and need never know
	  that the mail comes from IMAP.  &OfflineIMAP; will detect
	  changes to the mail folders on your IMAP server and your own
	  computer and bi-directionally synchronize them, copying,
	  marking, and deleting messages as necessary.
        </para>
	<para>
	  With &OfflineIMAP; 4.0, a powerful new ability has been
	  introduced -- the program can now synchronize two IMAP
	  servers with each other, with no need to have a Maildir
	  layer in-between.  Many people use this if they use a mail
	  reader on their local machine that does not support
	  Maildirs.  People may install an IMAP server on their local
	  machine, and point both &OfflineIMAP; and their mail reader
	  of choice at it.  This is often preferable to the mail
	  reader's own IMAP support since &OfflineIMAP; supports many
	  features (offline reading, for one) that most IMAP-aware
	  readers don't.  However, this feature is not as time-tested
	  as traditional syncing, so my advice is to stick with normal
	  methods of operation for the time being.
	</para>

    <refsect1>
      <title>Quick Start</title>
      <para>If you have already installed &OfflineIMAP; system-wide,
        or your system administrator has done that for you, your task
        for setting up &OfflineIMAP; for the first time is quite
        simple.  You just need to set up your configuration file, make
        your folder directory, and run it!
      </para>

	<para>You can quickly set up your configuration file.  The distribution
	  includes a file <filename>offlineimap.conf.minimal</filename>
	  (Debian users
        may find this at
          <filename>/usr/share/doc/offlineimap/examples/offlineimap.conf.minimal</filename>) that is a basic example of setting of &OfflineIMAP;.  You can
	  simply copy this file into your home directory and name it
	  <filename>.offlineimaprc</filename> (note the leading period).  A
	  command such as <command>cp offlineimap.conf.minimal ~/.offlineimaprc</command> will do it.  Or, if you prefer, you can just copy this text to
	  <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename>:
	</para>

	<PROGRAMLISTING>[general]
accounts = Test

[Account Test]
localrepository = Local
remoterepository = Remote

[Repository Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/Test

[Repository Remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = examplehost
remoteuser = jgoerzen
</PROGRAMLISTING>

        <para>Now, edit the <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename> file with
	  your favorite editor.  All you have to do is specify a directory
	  for your folders to be in (on the <property>localfolders</property>
	  line), the host name of your IMAP server (on the
	  <property>remotehost</property> line), and your login name on
	  the remote (on the <property>remoteuser</property> line).  That's
	  it!</para>

	<para>To run &OfflineIMAP;, you just have to say
	  <command>offlineimap</command> -- it will fire up, ask you for
	  a login password if necessary, synchronize your folders, and exit.
	  See?  You can just throw away the rest of this finely-crafted,
	  perfectly-honed manual!  Of course, if you want to see how you can
	  make &OfflineIMAP; FIVE TIMES FASTER FOR JUST $19.95 (err, well,
	  $0), you have to read on!

      <title>Installation</title>

      <para>If you are reading this document via the "man" command, it is
	likely
	that you have no installation tasks to perform; your system
	administrator has already installed it.  If you need to install it
	yourself, you have three options: a system-wide installation with
	Debian, system-wide installation with other systems, and a single-user
	installation.  You can download the latest version of &OfflineIMAP; from
	<ulink url="http://software.complete.org/offlineimap/">the &OfflineIMAP;
	website</ulink>.
      </para>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Prerequisites</title>

	<para>In order to use &OfflineIMAP;, you need to have these conditions
	  satisfied:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Your mail server must support IMAP.  Most Internet Service
	      Providers
	      and corporate networks do, and most operating systems
	      have an IMAP
	      implementation readily available.
              A special <property>Gmail</property> mailbox type is
              available to interface with Gmail's IMAP front-end.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      You must have Python version 2.4 or above installed.
	      If you are
	      running on Debian GNU/Linux, this requirement will automatically be
	      taken care of for you.  If you do not have Python already, check with
	      your system administrator or operating system vendor; or, download it from
	      <ulink url="http://www.python.org/">the Python website</ulink>.
		If you intend to use the SSL interface, your
		Python must have been built with SSL support.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Have a mail reader that supports the Maildir mailbox
	      format.  Most modern mail readers have this support
	      built-in, so you can choose from a wide variety of mail
	      servers.  This format is also known as the "qmail"
	      format, so any mail reader compatible with it will work
	      with &OfflineIMAP;.  If you do not have a mail reader
	      that supports Maildir, you can often install a local
	      IMAP server and point both &OfflineIMAP; and your mail
	      reader at it.

	<title>Multiple Accounts with Mutt</title>
	<para>
	  This example shows you how to set up &OfflineIMAP; to
	  synchronize multiple accounts with the mutt mail reader.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Start by creating a directory to hold your folders by running
	  <command>mkdir ~/Mail</command>.  Then, in your
	  <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename>, specify:
	</para>
	<programlisting>accounts = Personal, Work</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Make sure that you have both an
	  <property>[Account Personal]</property>
	  and an <property>[Account Work]</property> section.  The
	  local repository for each account must have different
	  <property>localfolder</> path names.
	  Also, make sure

	<para>
	  In each local repository section, write something like this:
	</para>
	<programlisting>localfolders = ~/Mail/Personal</programlisting>
	<para>

	<title>UID validity problem for folder</title>
	<para>IMAP servers use a unique ID (UID) to refer to a specific message.
	  This number is guaranteed to be unique to a particular message
	  <emphasis>forever</emphasis>.
	  No other message in the same folder will ever get the same
	  UID.  UIDs are an integral part of &OfflineIMAP;'s synchronization
	  scheme; they are used to match up messages on your computer to
	  messages on the server.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Sometimes, the UIDs on the server might get reset.  Usually this will
	  happen if you delete and then recreate a folder.  When you create a
	  folder, the server will often start the UID back from 1.  But
	  &OfflineIMAP; might still have the UIDs from the previous folder by the
	  same name stored.  &OfflineIMAP; will detect this condition and skip the
	  folder.  This is GOOD, because it prevents data loss.
	</para>

	<para>
	  You can fix it by removing your local folder and cache data.  For
	  instance, if your folders are under <filename>~/Folders</filename>
	  and the folder with the problem is INBOX, you'd type this:
	</para>

	<programlisting>rm -r ~/Folders/INBOX
rm -r ~/.offlineimap/Account-<replaceable>AccountName</>/LocalStatus/INBOX
rm -r ~/.offlineimap/Repository-<replaceable>RemoteRepositoryName</>/FolderValidity/INBOX</programlisting>

	<para>
	  (Of course, replace AccountName and RemoteRepositoryName 
	  with the names as specified
	  in <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename>).
	</para>

	<para>Next time you run &OfflineIMAP;, it will re-download
	  the folder with the
	  new UIDs.  Note that the procedure specified above will lose any local
	  changes made to the folder.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Some IMAP servers are broken and do not support UIDs properly.  If you
	  continue to get this error for all your folders even after performing
	  the above procedure, it is likely that your IMAP server falls into
	  this category.  &OfflineIMAP; is incompatible with such servers.
	  Using &OfflineIMAP; with them will not destroy any mail, but at the same time,
	  it will not actually synchronize it either.  (&OfflineIMAP; will detect
	  this condition and abort prior to synchronization.)

      <refsect2>
	<title>Deleting Local Folders</title>
	<para>&OfflineIMAP; does a two-way synchronization.  That is, if you
	  make a change to the mail on the server, it will be propagated to your
	  local copy, and vise-versa.  Some people might think that it would be
	  wise to just delete all their local mail folders periodically.  If you
	  do this with &OfflineIMAP;, remember to also remove your local status
	  cache (<filename>~/.offlineimap</filename> by default).  Otherwise, &OfflineIMAP; will take
	  this as an intentional deletion of many messages and will interpret
	  your action as requesting them to be deleted from the server as well.
	  (If you don't understand this, don't worry; you probably won't
	  encounter this situation.)
	</para>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Multiple Instances</title>
	<para>&OfflineIMAP; is not designed to have several instances (for instance, a cron job and an interactive invocation) run over the same
	  mailbox simultaneously.  It will perform a check on startup and
	  abort if another &OfflineIMAP; is already running.  If you need
	  to schedule synchronizations, you'll probably find
	  <property>autorefresh</property> settings more convenient than cron.
	  Alternatively, you can set a separate <property>metadata</property>
	  directory for each instance.
	</para>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Copying Messages Between Folders</title>
	<para>
	  Normally, when you copy a message between folders or add a new message
	  to a folder locally, &OfflineIMAP;
	  will just do the right thing.  However, sometimes this can be tricky
	  -- if your IMAP server does not provide the SEARCH command, or does
	  not return something useful, &OfflineIMAP;
	  cannot determine the new UID of the message.  So, in these rare
	  instances, OfflineIMAP will upload the message to the IMAP server and
	  delete it from your local folder.  Then, on your next sync, the
	  message will be re-downloaded with the proper UID.
	  &OfflineIMAP; makes sure that the message was properly uploaded before deleting it,
	  so there should be no risk of data loss.
	</para>

      <title>Upgrading to 4.0</title>
      <para>
	If you are upgrading from a version of &OfflineIMAP; prior to
	3.99.12, you will find that you will get errors when
	&OfflineIMAP; starts up (relating to ConfigParser or
	AccountHashGenerator) and the
	configuration file.  This is because the config file format
	had to change to accommodate new features in 4.0.  Fortunately,
	it's not difficult to adjust it to suit.
      </para>
      <para>
	First thing you need to do is stop any running &OfflineIMAP;
	instance, making sure first that it's synced all your mail.
	Then, modify your
	<filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename> file.  You'll need to
	split up each account section (make sure that it now starts
	with "Account ") into two Repository sections (one for the
	local side and another for the remote side.)  See the files
	<filename>offlineimap.conf.minimal</filename> and
	<filename>offlineimap.conf</filename> in the distribution if
	you need more assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
	&OfflineIMAP;'s status directory area has also changed.
	Therefore, you should delete everything in ~/.offlineimap as
	well as your local mail folders.
      </para>
      <para>
	When you start up &OfflineIMAP; 4.0, it will re-download all
	your mail from the server and then you can continue using it
	like normal.

      <para>
	Development on &OfflineIMAP; began on June 18, 2002.  Version
	1.0.0 was released three days later on June 21, 2002.  Point
	releases followed, including speed optimizations and some
	compatibility fixes.
      </para>
      <para>Version 2.0.0 was released on July 3, 2002, and
	represented the first time the synchronization became
	multithreaded and, to the best of my knowledge, the first
	multithreaded IMAP syncrhonizing application in existance.
	The last 2.0.x release, 2.0.8, was made on July 9.
      </para>
      <para>
	Version 3.0.0 was released on July 11, 2002, and introduced
	modular user interfaces and the first GUI interface for
	&OfflineIMAP;.  This manual also was introduced with 3.0.0,
	along with many command-line options.  Version 3.1.0 was
	released on July 21, adding the Noninteractive user
	interfaces, profiling support, and several bugfixes.  3.2.0
	was released on July 24, adding support for the Blinkenlights
	GUI interface.  &OfflineIMAP; entered maintenance mode for
	awhile, as it had reached a feature-complete milestone in my
	mind.
      </para>
      <para>
	The 3.99.x branch began in on October 7, 2002, to begin work
	for 4.0.  The Curses.Blinkenlights interface was added in
	3.99.6, and many architectural changes were made.
      </para>
      <para>
	4.0.0 was released on July 18, 2003, including the ability to
            synchronize directly between two IMAP servers, the first
            re-architecting of the configuration file to refine the
            notion of an account, and the new Curses interface.
