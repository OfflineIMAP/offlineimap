# OfflineIMAP

***"Get the emails where you need them."***

## Description

OfflineIMAP is software that downloads your email mailbox(es) as **local
Maildirs**. OfflineIMAP will synchronize both sides via *IMAP*.

IMAP's main downside is that you have to **trust** your email provider to
not lose your email. While certainly unlikely, it's not impossible.
With OfflineIMAP, you can download your Mailboxes and make you own backups of
your [Maildir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir).

This allows reading your email offline without the need for your mail
reader (MUA) to support IMAP operations. Need an attachment from a
message without internet connection? No problem, the message is still there.

## Project status and future

> As one of the maintainer of OfflineIMAP, I'd like to put my efforts into
> [imapfw](http://github.com/OfflineIMAP/imapfw). **imapfw** is software in
> development that I intend to replace OfflineIMAP with in the long term.
>
> That's why I'm not going to continue OfflineIMAP development. I'll continue
> to maintain OfflineIMAP (fixing small bugs, reviewing patches and merging,
> and rolling out new releases), but that's all.
>
> While I keep tracking issues for OfflineIMAP, you should not expect future support.
>
> You won't be left at the side. OfflineIMAP's community is large enough so that
> you'll find people for most of your issues.
>
> Get news from the [blog][blog].
