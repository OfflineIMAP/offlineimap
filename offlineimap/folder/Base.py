         Copy messages in self, but not statusfolder to dstfolder if not
         already in dstfolder. dstfolder might assign a new UID (e.g. if
         uploading to IMAP). Update statusfolder.

         Get all UIDS in statusfolder but not self. These are messages
         that were deleted in 'self'. Delete those from dstfolder and
         statusfolder.

         After this pass, the message lists should be identical wrt the
         uids present (except for potential negative uids that couldn't
         be placed anywhere).

        Pass3: Synchronize flag changes 
         Compare flag mismatches in self with those in statusfolder. If
         msg has a valid UID and exists on dstfolder (has not e.g. been
         deleted there), sync the flag change to both dstfolder and
         statusfolder.
