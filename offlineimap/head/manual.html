><P
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> is  a  tool  to  simplify  your  e-mail
	reading.  With <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
>, you can read the same mailbox
	from multiple computers.  You get a current copy of your
	messages on each computer, and changes you make one place will be
	visible on all other systems.  For instance, you can delete a message
	on your home computer, and it will appear deleted on your work
	computer as well.  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> is also useful if you want to
	use a mail reader that does not have IMAP support, has poor IMAP
	support, or does not provide disconnected operation.
      </P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>FAST</I
></SPAN
>; it synchronizes
        my two accounts with over 50 folders in 3 seconds.  Other
        similar tools might take over a minute, and achieve a
        less-reliable result.  Some mail readers can take over 10
        minutes to do the same thing, and some don't even support it
        at all.  Unlike other mail tools, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> features a
        multi-threaded synchronization algorithm that can dramatically
        speed up performance in many situations by synchronizing
        several different things simultaneously.

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>FLEXIBLE</I

>; you can
        customize which folders are synced via regular expressions,
        lists, or Python expressions; a versatile and comprehensive
        configuration file is used to control behavior; two user
        interfaces are built-in; fine-tuning of synchronization
        performance is possible; internal or external automation is
        supported; SSL and PREAUTH tunnels are both supported; offline
        (or "unplugged") reading is supported; and esoteric IMAP
        features are supported to ensure compatibility with the widest
        variety of IMAP servers.

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

        algorithm designed to prevent mail loss at all costs.  Because
        of the design of this algorithm, even programming errors
        should not result in loss of mail.  I am so confident in the
        algorithm that I use my own personal and work accounts for
        testing of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> pre-release, development, and beta
	releases.  Of course, legally speaking, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

>Method of Operation</H3
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> traditionally 
	  operates by maintaining a hierarchy of
	  mail folders in Maildir format locally.  Your own mail
	  reader will read mail from this tree, and need never know
	  that the mail comes from IMAP.  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> will detect
	  changes to the mail folders on your IMAP server and your own
	  computer and bi-directionally synchronize them, copying,
	  marking, and deleting messages as necessary.
        </P
><P
>	  With <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> 4.0, a powerful new ability has been
	  introduced -- the program can now synchronize two IMAP
	  servers with each other, with no need to have a Maildir
	  layer in-between.  Many people use this if they use a mail
	  reader on their local machine that does not support
	  Maildirs.  People may install an IMAP server on their local
	  machine, and point both <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> and their mail reader
	  of choice at it.  This is often preferable to the mail
	  reader's own IMAP support since <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> supports many
	  features (offline reading, for one) that most IMAP-aware
	  readers don't.  However, this feature is not as time-tested
	  as traditional syncing, so my advice is to stick with normal
	  methods of operation for the time being.

>If you have already installed <SPAN

        for setting up <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> for the first time is quite
        simple.  You just need to set up your configuration file, make
        your folder directory, and run it!
      </P
><P
>You can quickly set up your configuration file.  The distribution
	  includes a file <TT

	  (Debian users
	  may find this at

>OfflineIMAP</SPAN

	  simply copy this file into your home directory and name it
	  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.offlineimaprc</TT

><UL

><P
>Your mail server must support IMAP.  Most Internet Service

	      If you are
	      running on Debian GNU/Linux, this requirement will automatically be
	      taken care of for you.  If you do not have Python already, check with
	      your system administrator or operating system vendor; or, download it from
	      <A
HREF="http://www.python.org/"
TARGET="_top"

	      If you intend to use the Tk interface, you must have Tkinter

		Python must have been built with SSL support.

>	      Have a mail reader that supports the Maildir mailbox
	      format.  Most modern mail readers have this support
	      built-in, so you can choose from a wide variety of mail
	      servers.  This format is also known as the "qmail"
	      format, so any mail reader compatible with it will work
	      with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

	      that supports Maildir, you can often install a local

	    In order to do a reliable sync, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

	    must have a way to
	    uniquely identify each e-mail.  Three pieces of information are

	<SPAN

>Upgrading to 4.0</H2
><P
>	If you are upgrading from a version of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> prior to
	3.99.12, you will find that you will get errors when
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> starts up (relating to ConfigParser or
	AccountHashGenerator) and the
	configuration file.  This is because the config file format
	had to change to accommodate new features in 4.0.  Fortunately,
	it's not difficult to adjust it to suit.
      </P
><P
>	First thing you need to do is stop any running <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
>
	instance, making sure first that it's synced all your mail.
	Then, modify your
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.offlineimaprc</TT
> file.  You'll need to
	split up each account section (make sure that it now starts
	with "Account ") into two Repository sections (one for the
	local side and another for the remote side.)  See the files
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>offlineimap.conf.minimal</TT
> and
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>offlineimap.conf</TT
> in the distribution if
	you need more assistance.
      </P
><P
>	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
>'s status directory area has also changed.
	Therefore, you should delete everything in ~/.offlineimap as
	well as your local mail folders.
      </P
><P
>	When you start up <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> 4.0, it will re-download all
	your mail from the server and then you can continue using it
	like normal.

>	Development on <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> began on June 18, 2002.  Version
	1.0.0 was released three days later on June 21, 2002.  Point
	releases followed, including speed optimizations and some
	compatibility fixes.
      </P
><P
>Version 2.0.0 was released on July 3, 2002, and
	represented the first time the synchronization became
	multithreaded and, to the best of my knowledge, the first
	multithreaded IMAP syncrhonizing application in existance.
	The last 2.0.x release, 2.0.8, was made on July 9.
      </P
><P
>	Version 3.0.0 was released on July 11, 2002, and introduced
	modular user interfaces and the first GUI interface for
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
>.  This manual also was introduced with 3.0.0,
	along with many command-line options.  Version 3.1.0 was
	released on July 21, adding the Noninteractive user
	interfaces, profiling support, and several bugfixes.  3.2.0
	was released on July 24, adding support for the Blinkenlights
	GUI interface.  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>OfflineIMAP</SPAN
> entered maintenance mode for
	awhile, as it had reached a feature-complete milestone in my
	mind.
      </P
><P
>	The 3.99.x branch began in on October 7, 2002, to begin work
	for 4.0.  The Curses.Blinkenlights interface was added in
	3.99.6, and many architectural changes were made.
      </P
><P
>	4.0.0 was released on July 18, 2003, including the ability to
            synchronize directly between two IMAP servers, the first
            re-architecting of the configuration file to refine the
            notion of an account, and the new Curses interface.
