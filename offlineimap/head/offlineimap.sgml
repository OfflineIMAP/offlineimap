      <title>Description</title>

      <para>&OfflineIMAP; is  a  tool  to  simplify  your  e-mail
	reading.  With &OfflineIMAP;, you can read the same mailbox
	from multiple computers.  You get a current copy of your
	messages on each computer, and changes you make one place will be
	visible on all other systems.  For instance, you can delete a message
	on your home computer, and it will appear deleted on your work
	computer as well.  &OfflineIMAP; is also useful if you want to
	use a mail reader that does not have IMAP support, has poor IMAP
	support, or does not provide disconnected operation.
      </para>

      <para>&OfflineIMAP; is <emphasis>FAST</emphasis>; it synchronizes
        my two accounts with over 50 folders in 3 seconds.  Other
        similar tools might take over a minute, and achieve a
        less-reliable result.  Some mail readers can take over 10
        minutes to do the same thing, and some don't even support it
        at all.  Unlike other mail tools, &OfflineIMAP; features a
        multi-threaded synchronization algorithm that can dramatically
        speed up performance in many situations by synchronizing
        several different things simultaneously.
      </para>

      <para>&OfflineIMAP; is <emphasis>FLEXIBLE</emphasis>; you can
        customize which folders are synced via regular expressions,
        lists, or Python expressions; a versatile and comprehensive
        configuration file is used to control behavior; two user
        interfaces are built-in; fine-tuning of synchronization
        performance is possible; internal or external automation is
        supported; SSL and PREAUTH tunnels are both supported; offline
        (or "unplugged") reading is supported; and esoteric IMAP
        features are supported to ensure compatibility with the widest
        variety of IMAP servers.
      </para>

      <para>&OfflineIMAP; is <emphasis>SAFE</emphasis>; it uses an
        algorithm designed to prevent mail loss at all costs.  Because
        of the design of this algorithm, even programming errors
        should not result in loss of mail.  I am so confident in the
        algorithm that I use my own personal and work accounts for
        testing of &OfflineIMAP; pre-release, development, and beta
	releases.  Of course, legally speaking, &OfflineIMAP; comes
        with no warranty, so I am not responsible if this turns out
        to be wrong.
      </para>

      <refsect2>
        <title>Method of Operation</title>
       
        <para>&OfflineIMAP; operates by maintaining a hierarchy of
	  mail folders in Maildir format locally.  Your own mail
	  reader will read mail from this tree, and need never know
	  that the mail comes from IMAP.  &OfflineIMAP; will detect
	  changes to the mail folders on your IMAP server and your own
	  computer and bi-directionally synchronize them, copying,
	  marking, and deleting messages as necessary.
        </para>
      </refsect2>
    </refsect1>
    
    <refsect1>
      <title>Quick Start</title>
      <para>If you have already installed &OfflineIMAP; system-wide,
        or your system adminstrator has done that for you, your task
        for setting up &OfflineIMAP; for the first time is quite
        simple.  You just need to set up your configuration file, make
        your folder directory, and run it!
      </para>

	<para>You can quickly set up your configuration file.  The distribution
	  includes a file <filename>offlineimap.conf.minimal</filename>
	  (Debian users
	  may find this at
          <filename>/usr/share/doc/offlineimap/examples/offlineimap.conf.minimal</filename>) that is a basic example of setting of &OfflineIMAP;.  You can
	  simply copy this file into your home directory and name it
	  <filename>.offlineimaprc</filename> (note the leading period).  A
	  command such as <command>cp offlineimap.conf.minimal ~/.offlineimaprc</command> will do it.  Or, if you prefer, you can just copy this text to
	  <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename>:
	</para>

	<PROGRAMLISTING>[general]
accounts = Test

[Test]
localfolders = ~/Test
remotehost = examplehost
remoteuser = jgoerzen
</PROGRAMLISTING>

        <para>Now, edit the <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename> file with
	  your favorite editor.  All you have to do is specify a directory
	  for your folders to be in (on the <property>localfolders</property>
	  line), the host name of your IMAP server (on the
	  <property>remotehost</property> line), and your login name on
	  the remote (on the <property>remoteuser</property> line).  That's
	  it!</para>

	<para>To run &OfflineIMAP;, you just have to say
	  <command>offlineimap</command> -- it will fire up, ask you for
	  a login password if necessary, synchronize your folders, and exit.
	  See?  You can just throw away the rest of this finely-crafted,
	  perfectly-honed manual!  Of course, if you want to see how you can
	  make &OfflineIMAP; FIVE TIMES FASTER FOR JUST $19.95 (err, well,
	  $0), you have to read on!

      <title>Installation</title>

      <para>If you are reading this document via the "man" command, it is
	likely
	that you have no installation tasks to perform; your system
	administrator has already installed it.  If you need to install it
	yourself, you have three options: a system-wide installation with
	Debian, system-wide installation with other systems, and a single-user
	installation.  You can download the latest version of &OfflineIMAP; from
	<ulink url="http://quux.org/devel/offlineimap/">the &OfflineIMAP;
	website</ulink>.
      </para>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Prerequisites</title>

	<para>In order to use &OfflineIMAP;, you need to have these conditions
	  satisfied:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Your mail server must support IMAP.  Most Internet Service
	      Providers
	      and corporate networks do, and most operating systems
	      have an IMAP
	      implementation readily available.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      You must have Python version 2.2.1 or above installed.
	      If you are
	      running on Debian GNU/Linux, this requirement will automatically be
	      taken care of for you.  If you do not have Python already, check with
	      your system administrator or operating system vendor; or, download it from
	      <ulink url="http://www.python.org/">the Python website</ulink>.
	      If you intend to use the Tk interface, you must have Tkinter
		(python-tk) installed.  If you intend to use the SSL interface, your
		Python must have been built with SSL support.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Have a mail reader that supports the Maildir mailbox format.  Most
	      modern mail readers have this support built-in, so you can choose from
	      a wide variety of mail servers.  This format is also known as the
	      "qmail" format, so any mail reader compatible with it will work with
	      &OfflineIMAP;.

	<ProgramListing>tar -zxvf offlineimap_x.y.z.tar.gz
cd offlineimap-x.y.z
python2.2 setup.py install</ProgramListing>
	<para>On some systems, you will need to use
	  <command>python</command> instead of <command>python2.2</command>.
	  Next, proceed to <xref linkend="configuration" endterm="configuration-title"> below.  You will type <command>offlineimap</command> to

	</para>

	<ProgramListing>tar -zxvf offlineimap_x.y.z.tar.gz
cd offlineimap-x.y.z</ProgramListing>

	<para>When you want to run &OfflineIMAP;, you will issue the

      <title id="configuration-title">Configruation</title>
      <para>
	&OfflineIMAP; is regulated by a configuration file that is normally 
	stored in <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename>.  &OfflineIMAP;
	ships with a file named <filename>offlineimap.conf</filename>
	that you should copy to that location and then edit.  This file is
	vital to proper operation of the system; it sets everything you need
	to run &OfflineIMAP;.  Full documentation for the configuration file
	is included within the sample file.
      </para>
      <para>
	&OfflineIMAP; also ships a file named
	<filename>offlineimap.conf.minimal</filename> that you can also try.
	  It's useful if you want to get started with

	<title>Tk.Blinkenlights</title>
	<para>Tk.Blinkenlights is an interface designed to be sleek, fun to watch, and
	  informative of the overall picture of what &OfflineIMAP;
	  is doing.  I consider it to be the best general-purpose interface in
	  &OfflineIMAP;.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Tk.Blinkenlights contains, by default, a small window with a row of
	  LEDs, a small log, and a row of command buttons.
	  The total size of the window is
	  very small, so it uses little desktop space, yet it is quite
	  functional.  The optional, toggleable, log shows more
	  detail about what is happening and is color-coded to match the color
	  of the lights.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Tk.Blinkenlights is the only user interface that has configurable
	  parameters; see the example <filename>offlineimap.conf</filename>
	  for more details.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Each light in the Blinkenlights interface represents a thread
	  of execution -- that is, a particular task that &OfflineIMAP;
	  is performing right now.  The colors indicate what task
	  the particular thread is performing, and are as follows:
	</para>
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Black</term>
	    <listitem><para>indicates that this light's thread has terminated; it will light up

	<para>The name of this interfaces derives from a bit of computer

	<title>Curses.Blinkenlights</title>
	<para>
	  Curses.Blinkenlights is an interface very similar to Tk.Blinkenlights,
	  but is designed to be run in a console window (an xterm, Linux virtual
	  terminal, etc.)  Since it doesn't have access to graphics, it isn't
	  quite as pretty, but it still gets the job done.

	<title>Tk.VerboseUI</title>
	<para>
	  Tk.VerboseUI (formerly known as Tk.TkUI) is a graphical interface
	  that presents a variable-sized window.  In the window, each
	  currently-executing thread has a section where its name and current
	  status are displayed.  This interface is best suited to people running
	  on slower connections, as you get a lot of detail, but for fast
	  connections, the detail may go by too quickly to be useful.  People
	  with fast connections may wish to use Tk.Blinkenlights instead.
	</para>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>TTY.TTYUI</title>
	<para>
	  TTY.TTYUI interface is for people running in basic, non-color terminals.  It

	  or xterm.
	</para>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Noninteractive.Basic</title>
	<para>
	  Noninteractive.Basic is designed for situations in which &OfflineIMAP;
	  will be run non-attended and the status of its execution will be
	  logged.  You might use it, for instance, to have the system run
	  automatically and
	  e-mail you the results of the synchronization.  This user interface
	  is not capable of reading a password from the keyboard; account
	  passwords must be specified using one of the configuration file options.
	</para>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Noninteractive.Quiet</title>
	<para>
	  Noninteractive.Quiet is designed for non-attended running in situations
	  where normal status messages are not desired.  It will output nothing
	  except errors and serious warnings.  Like Noninteractive.Basic,
	  this user interface

	<title>Multiple Accounts with Mutt</title>
	<para>
	  This example shows you how to set up &OfflineIMAP; to
	  synchronize multiple accounts with the mutt mail reader.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Start by creating a directory to hold your folders by running
	  <command>mkdir ~/Mail</command>.  Then, in your
	  <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename>, specify:
	</para>
	<programlisting>accounts = Personal, Work</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Make sure that you have both a <property>[Personal]</property>
	  and a <property>[Work]</property> section, each with different
	  <property>localfolder</property> path names.  Also, make sure
	  to enable <property>[mbnames]</property>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In each account section, write something like this:
	</para>
	<programlisting>localfolders = ~/Mail/Personal</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Finally, add these lines to your <filename>~/.muttrc</filename>:
	</para>
	<programlisting>source ~/path-to-mbnames-muttrc-mailboxes
folder-hook Personal set from="youremail@personal.com"
folder-hook Work set from="youremail@work.com"
set mbox_type=Maildir
set folder=$HOME/Mail
spoolfile=+Personal/INBOX</programlisting>
	<para>
	  That's it!
	</para>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>UW-IMAPD and References</title>
	<para>Some users with a UW-IMAPD server need to use &OfflineIMAP;'s
	  "reference" feature to get at their mailboxes, specifying a reference
	  of "~/Mail" or "#mh/" depending on the configuration.  The below
	  configuration from docwhat@gerf.org
	  shows using a <property>reference</property> of Mail, a <property>nametrans</property>
	  that strips
	  the leading Mail/ off incoming folder names, and a
	  <property>folderfilter</property> that
	  limits the folders synced to just three.
	</para>
	<programlisting>[Gerf]
localfolders = ~/Mail
remotehost = gerf.org
ssl = yes
remoteuser = docwhat
reference = Mail
# Trims off the preceeding Mail on all the folder names.
nametrans = lambda foldername: \
            re.sub('^Mail/', '', foldername)
# Yeah, you have to mention the Mail dir, even though it
# would seem intuitive that reference would trim it.
folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername in [
      'Mail/INBOX',
      'Mail/list/zaurus-general',
      'Mail/list/zaurus-dev',
      ]
maxconnections = 1
holdconnectionopen = no</programlisting>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>pythonfile Configuration File Option</title>
	<para>You can have &OfflineIMAP;
	  load up a Python file before evaluating the
	  configuration file options that are Python expressions.  This example
	  is based on one supplied by Tommi Virtanen for this feature.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In <filename>~/.offlineimap.rc</filename>, he adds these options:
	</para>
	<programlisting>[general]
pythonfile=~/.offlineimap.py
[foo]
foldersort=mycmp</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Then, the <filename>~/.offlineimap.py</filename> file will
	  contain:
	</para>
	<programlisting>prioritized = ['INBOX', 'personal', 'announce', 'list']

def mycmp(x, y):
   for prefix in prioritized:
       if x.startswith(prefix):
           return -1
       elif y.startswith(prefix):
           return +1
   return cmp(x, y)

def test_mycmp():
   import os, os.path
   folders=os.listdir(os.path.expanduser('~/data/mail/tv@hq.yok.utu.fi'))
   folders.sort(mycmp)
   print folders</programlisting>
	<para>
	  This code snippet illustrates how the <property>foldersort</property>
	  option can be customized with a Python function from the
	  <property>pythonfile</property> to always synchronize certain
	  folders first.
	</para>

      <title>Errors</title>
      <para>

	please check this section.
      </para>
      
      <refsect2>
	<title>UID validity problem for folder</title>
	<para>IMAP servers use a unique ID (UID) to refer to a specific message.
	  This number is guaranteed to be unique to a particular message
	  <emphasis>forever</emphasis>.
	  No other message in the same folder will ever get the same
	  UID.  UIDs are an integral part of &OfflineIMAP;'s synchronization
	  scheme; they are used to match up messages on your computer to
	  messages on the server.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Sometimes, the UIDs on the server might get reset.  Usually this will
	  happen if you delete and then recreate a folder.  When you create a
	  folder, the server will often start the UID back from 1.  But
	  &OfflineIMAP; might still have the UIDs from the previous folder by the
	  same name stored.  &OfflineIMAP; will detect this condition and skip the
	  folder.  This is GOOD, because it prevents data loss.
	</para>

	<para>
	  You can fix it by removing your local folder and cache data.  For
	  instance, if your folders are under <filename>~/Folders</filename>
	  and the folder with the problem is INBOX, you'd type this:
	</para>

	<programlisting>rm -r ~/Folders/INBOX
rm -r ~/.offlineimap/AccountName/INBOX</programlisting>

	<para>
	  (Of course, replace AccountName with the account name as specified
	  in <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename>).
	</para>

	<para>Next time you run &OfflineIMAP;, it will re-download
	  the folder with the
	  new UIDs.  Note that the procedure specified above will lose any local
	  changes made to the folder.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Some IMAP servers are broken and do not support UIDs properly.  If you
	  continue to get this error for all your folders even after performing
	  the above procedure, it is likely that your IMAP server falls into
	  this category.  &OfflineIMAP; is incompatible with such servers.
	  Using &OfflineIMAP; with them will not destroy any mail, but at the same time,
	  it will not actually synchronize it either.  (&OfflineIMAP; will detect
	  this condition and abort prior to synchronization.)

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term>What platforms does &OfflineIMAP; run on?</term>

	  </para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>I'm using Mutt.  Other IMAP sync programs require me to use "set maildir_trash=yes".  Do I need to do that with &OfflineIMAP;?</term>
	  <listitem><para>
	    No.  &OfflineIMAP; is smart enough to figure out message deletion without this extra

	<varlistentry><term>How do I specify the names of my folders?</term>
  	  <listitem><para>
	    You do not need to.  &OfflineIMAP; is smart
	    enough to automatically figure out what folders are present
	    on the IMAP server and synchronize them.  You can use the
	    <property>folderfilter</property> and <property>foldertrans</property>
	    configuration file options to request certain folders and rename them
	    as they come in if you like.

	    &OfflineIMAP; can help these programs by writing the names

	    <filename>offlineimap.conf</filename> for details.
	  </para></listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>Can I synchronize multiple accounts with &OfflineIMAP?</term>
	  <listitem><para>Sure.  Just name them all in the

	    section of the configuration file, and add a per-account section
	    for each one.
	  </para></listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>Does &OfflineIMAP; support POP?</term>
	  <listitem><para>No.  POP is not robust enough to do a completely reliable
	    multi-machine synchronization like &OfflineIMAP; can do.  &OfflineIMAP;
	    will not support it.
	  </para></listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>Does &OfflineIMAP; support mailbox formats other than Maildir?</term>
	  <listitem><para>Not at present.  There is no technical reason not to; just no
	    demand yet.  Maildir is a superior format anyway.
	  </para></listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>[technical] Why are your Maildir message filenames so huge?</term>
	  <listitem><para>&OfflineIMAP; has two relevant principles: 1) never modifying your
	    messages in any way and 2) ensuring 100% reliable synchronizations.
	    In order to do a reliable sync, &OfflineIMAP;
	    must have a way to
	    uniquely identify each e-mail.  Three pieces of information are
	    required to do this: your account name, the folder name, and the
	    message UID.  The account name can be calculated from the path in
	    which your messages are.  The folder name can usually be as well, BUT
	    some mail clients move messages between folders by simply moving the
	    file, leaving the name intact.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    So, &OfflineIMAP; must store both a UID folder ID.  The folder ID is
	    necessary so &OfflineIMAP; can detect a message moved to a different
	    folder.  &OfflineIMAP; stores the UID (U= number) and an md5sum of the
	    foldername (FMD5= number) to facilitate this.
	  </para></listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>What is the speed of &OfflineIMAP;'s sync?</term>
	  <listitem><para>OfflineIMAP
	    versions 2.0 and above contain a multithreaded system.  A good way to
	    experiment is by setting <property>maxsyncaccounts</property> to 3 and <property>maxconnections</property> to 3
	    in each account clause.
	  </para>
	  <para>This lets OfflineIMAP open up multiple connections simultaneously.
	    That will let it process multiple folders and messages at once.  In
	    most cases, this will increase performance of the sync.
	  </para>
	  <para>Don't set the number too high.  If you do that, things might actually
	    slow down as your link gets saturated.  Also, too many connections can
	    cause mail servers to have excessive load.  Administrators might take
	    unkindly to this, and the server might bog down.  There are many
	    variables in the optimal setting; experimentation may help.

	<title>Deleting Local Folders</title>
	<para>&OfflineIMAP; does a two-way synchronization.  That is, if you
	  make a change to the mail on the server, it will be propogated to your
	  local copy, and vise-versa.  Some people might think that it would be
	  wise to just delete all their local mail folders periodically.  If you
	  do this with &OfflineIMAP;, remember to also remove your local status
	  cache (<filename>~/.offlineimap</filename> by default).  Otherwise, &OfflineIMAP; will take
	  this as an intentional deletion of many messages and will interpret
	  your action as requesting them to be deleted from the server as well.
	  (If you don't understand this, don't worry; you probably won't
	  encounter this situation)
	</para>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Multiple Instances</title>
	<para>&OfflineIMAP; is not designed to have several instances (for instance, a cron job and an interactive invocation) run over the same
	  mailbox simultaneously.  It will perform a check on startup and
	  abort if another &OfflineIMAP; is already running.  If you need
	  to schedule synchronizations, please use the
	  <property>autorefresh</property> settings rather than cron.
	  Alternatively, you can set a separate <property>metadata</property>
	  directory for each instance.

	<title>Copying Messages Between Folders</title>
	<para>
	  Normally, when you copy a message between folders or add a new message
	  to a folder locally, &OfflineIMAP;
	  will just do the right thing.  However, sometimes this can be tricky
	  -- if your IMAP server does not provide the SEARCH command, or does
	  not return something useful, &OfflineIMAP;
	  cannot determine the new UID of the message.  So, in these rare
	  instances, OfflineIMAP will upload the message to the IMAP server and
	  delete it from your local folder.  Then, on your next sync, the
	  message will be re-downloaded with the proper UID.
	  &OfflineIMAP; makes sure that the message was properly uploaded before deleting it,
	  so there should be no risk of data loss.
	</para>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Use with Evolution</title>
	<para>&OfflineIMAP; can work with Evolution.  To do so, first configure
	  your &OfflineIMAP; account to have
	  <option>sep = /</option> in its configuration.  Then, configure
	  Evolution with the
	  "Maildir-format mail directories" server type.  For the path, you will need to
	  specify the name of the top-level folder
	  <emphasis>inside</emphasis> your &OfflineIMAP; storage location.
	  You're now set!

	<title>Use with KMail</title>
	<para>At this time, I believe that &OfflineIMAP; is not compatible
