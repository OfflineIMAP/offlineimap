Message filtering
=================

There are two ways to selectively filter messages out of a folder, using
`maxsize` and `maxage`. Setting each option will basically ignore all messages
that are on the server by pretending they don't exist.

:todo: explain them and give tips on how to use and not use them. Use cases!
