   IMAP4 Extension for Returning STATUS Information in Extended LIST

Abstract

   Many IMAP clients display information about total number of
   messages / total number of unseen messages in IMAP mailboxes.  In
   order to do that, they are forced to issue a LIST or LSUB command and
   to list all available mailboxes, followed by a STATUS command for
   each mailbox found.  This document provides an extension to LIST
   command that allows the client to request STATUS information for
   mailboxes together with other information typically returned by the
   LIST command.

1.  Introduction

   Many IMAP clients display information about the total number of
   messages / total number of unseen messages in IMAP mailboxes.  In
   order to do that, they are forced to issue a LIST or LSUB command and
   to list all available mailboxes, followed by a STATUS command for
   each mailbox found.  This document provides an extension to LIST
   command that allows the client to request STATUS information for
   mailboxes together with other information typically returned by the
   LIST command.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [Kwds].

2.  STATUS Return Option to LIST Command

   [RFC3501] explicitly disallows mailbox patterns in the STATUS
   command.  The main reason was to discourage frequent use of the
   STATUS command by clients, as it might be quite expensive for an IMAP
   server to perform.  However, this prohibition had resulted in an
   opposite effect: a new generation of IMAP clients appeared, that
   issues a STATUS command for each mailbox returned by the LIST
   command.  This behavior is suboptimal to say at least.  It wastes
   extra bandwidth and, in the case of a client that doesn't support
   IMAP pipelining, also degrades performance by using too many round
   trips.  This document tries to remedy the situation by specifying a
   single command that can be used by the client to request all the
   necessary information.  In order to achieve this goal, this document
   is extending the LIST command with a new return option, STATUS.  This
   option takes STATUS data items as parameters.  For each selectable

   mailbox matching the list pattern and selection options, the server
   MUST return an untagged LIST response followed by an untagged STATUS
   response containing the information requested in the STATUS return
   option.

   If an attempted STATUS for a listed mailbox fails because the mailbox
   can't be selected (e.g., if the "l" ACL right [ACL] is granted to the
   mailbox and the "r" right is not granted, or due to a race condition
   between LIST and STATUS changing the mailbox to \NoSelect), the
   STATUS response MUST NOT be returned and the LIST response MUST
   include the \NoSelect attribute.  This means the server may have to
   buffer the LIST reply until it has successfully looked up the
   necessary STATUS information.

   If the server runs into unexpected problems while trying to look up
   the STATUS information, it MAY drop the corresponding STATUS reply.
   In such a situation, the LIST command would still return a tagged OK
   reply.

3.  Examples

   C: A01 LIST "" % RETURN (STATUS (MESSAGES UNSEEN))
   S: * LIST () "."  "INBOX"
   S: * STATUS "INBOX" (MESSAGES 17 UNSEEN 16)
   S: * LIST () "." "foo"
   S: * STATUS "foo" (MESSAGES 30 UNSEEN 29)
   S: * LIST (\NoSelect) "." "bar"
   S: A01 OK List completed.

   The "bar" mailbox isn't selectable, so it has no STATUS reply.

   C: A02 LIST (SUBSCRIBED RECURSIVEMATCH)"" % RETURN (STATUS
      (MESSAGES))
   S: * LIST (\Subscribed) "."  "INBOX"
   S: * STATUS "INBOX" (MESSAGES 17)
   S: * LIST () "." "foo" (CHILDINFO ("SUBSCRIBED"))
   S: A02 OK List completed.

   The LIST reply for "foo" is returned because it has matching
   children, but no STATUS reply is returned because "foo" itself
   doesn't match the selection criteria.

4.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [ABNF].  Terms not defined here are taken
   from [RFC3501] and [LISTEXT].

   return-option =/ status-option

   status-option = "STATUS" SP "(" status-att *(SP status-att) ")"
                   ;; This ABNF production complies with
                   ;; <option-extension> syntax.

5.  Security Considerations

   This extension makes it a bit easier for clients to overload the
   server by requesting STATUS information for a large number of
   mailboxes.  However, as already noted in the introduction, existing
   clients already try to do that by generating a large number of STATUS
   commands for each mailbox in which they are interested.  While
   performing STATUS information retrieval for big lists of mailboxes, a
   server implementation needs to make sure that it can still serve
   other IMAP connections and yield execution to other connections, when
   necessary.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a Standards Track or
   IESG-approved Experimental RFC.  The "IMAP 4 Capabilities" registry
   is available from the IANA webiste:

      http://www.iana.org

   This document defines the LIST-STATUS IMAP capability.  IANA has
   added it to the registry.

   IANA has also added the following new LIST-EXTENDED option to the
   IANA registry established by [LISTEXT]:

   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of LIST-EXTENDED option STATUS

   LIST-EXTENDED option name: STATUS

   LIST-EXTENDED option type: RETURN

   LIST-EXTENDED option description: Causes the LIST command to return
   STATUS responses in addition to LIST responses.

   Thanks to Philip Van Hoof who pointed out that STATUS and LIST
   commands should be combined in order to optimize traffic and number
   of round trips.
