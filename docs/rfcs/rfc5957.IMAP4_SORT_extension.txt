1.  Introduction

   The [SORT] extension to the [IMAP] protocol provides a means for the
   server-based sorting of messages.  It defines a set of sort criteria
   and the mechanism for determining the sort value of a message for
   each such ordering.

   The [SORT] FROM and TO orderings sort messages lexically on the
   [IMAP] addr-mailbox of the first address in the message's From and To
   headers, respectively.  This document provides two alternative
   orderings, DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO, which sort messages based on
   the first From or To address's [IMAP] addr-name (generally the same
   as its [RFC5322] display-name), when present.

   A server that supports the full [SORT] extension as well as both the
   DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO sort criteria indicates this by returning
   "SORT=DISPLAY" in its CAPABILITY response.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  DISPLAY Sort Value for an Address

   For the purposes of the sort criteria defined in this document, the
   sort value for an [IMAP] address structure is defined as follows:

   o  If the address structure's [IMAP] addr-name is non-NIL, apply the
      procedure from [RFC5255], Section 4.6.  (That is, decode any
      [RFC2047] encoded-words and convert the resulting character string
      into a charset valid for the currently active [RFC4790] collation,
      with a default of UTF-8.)  If the resulting octet string is not
      the empty string, use it as the sort value for the address.

   o  Otherwise, if the address structure's [IMAP] addr-mailbox and
      [IMAP] addr-host are both non-NIL, the sort value for the address
      is addr-mailbox@addr-host.

   o  Otherwise, if the address structure's [IMAP] addr-mailbox is non-
      NIL, the sort value for the address is its addr-mailbox.

   o  If none of the above conditions are met, the sort value for the
      address is the empty string.

4.  The DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO Sort Criteria

   This document introduces two new [SORT] sort criteria, DISPLAYFROM
   and DISPLAYTO.  A message's sort value under these orderings MUST be
   derived as follows:

   A "derived-addr" value is created from the [IMAP] envelope structure
   resulting from a FETCH ENVELOPE on the message.  For DISPLAYFROM, the
   derived-addr value is the [IMAP] env-from value.  For DISPLAYTO, the
   derived-addr value is the [IMAP] env-to value.

   o  If the derived-addr value is NIL, the message's sort value is the
      empty string.

   o  Otherwise, the message's sort value is the DISPLAY sort value of
      the first [IMAP] address in the derived-addr value.

5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234].  [IMAP] defines the
   non-terminal "capability", and [SORT] defines "sort-key".

   capability    =/ "SORT=DISPLAY"

   sort-key      =/ "DISPLAYFROM" / "DISPLAYTO"

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an additional IMAP4 capability.  As such, it
   does not change the underlying security considerations of [IMAP].
   The author believes that no new security issues are introduced with
   this additional IMAP4 capability.

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO are string-based sort criteria.  As stated
   in [SORT], the active [RFC4790] collation as per [RFC5255] MUST be
   used when sorting such strings.

   The DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO orderings sort on the full decoded
   [IMAP] addr-name, when present.  They do not attempt to parse this
   string in a locale- or language-dependent manner in order to
   determine and sort on some semantically meaningful substring such as
   the surname.

8.  IANA Considerations

   [IMAP] capabilities are registered by publishing a Standards Track or
   IESG-approved Experimental RFC.  This document constitutes
   registration of the SORT=DISPLAY capability in the [IMAP]
   capabilities registry.
